## 🎯 Why Privacy Policy Looks Different

**It's SUPPOSED to look different!**

### Reasons:
1. **App Store Requirement** - Legal pages should look professional, not marketing
2. **User Expectation** - People expect legal docs to look like documents
3. **Readability** - Simple design makes legal text easier to read
4. **Industry Standard** - All major apps have different legal page designs
5. **Trust** - Document-style layout builds credibility

### What's SAME:
- Logo and branding
- Font (Inter)
- Color scheme (red primary)
- Navigation bar
- Scroll effects
- Mobile responsive

### What's DIFFERENT (by design):
- No hero section
- No feature cards
- No animations on content
- Clean white background
- Document-style layout
- Simple footer

**This is CORRECT and PROFESSIONAL! ✅**
