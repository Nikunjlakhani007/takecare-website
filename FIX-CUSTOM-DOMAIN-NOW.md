# 🔧 Fix Custom Domain - Images Not Loading Issue

## 🔍 Problem Found

Your domain `takemycare.me` is currently pointing to:
```
http://takemycare.me/takecare-website/  ❌ WRONG
```

It should point to:
```
https://takemycare.me/  ✅ CORRECT
```

**Why images don't load:**
- Your images use paths like `./assets/logo.png`
- When accessed via `/takecare-website/` subdirectory, the browser looks for:
  - `http://takemycare.me/takecare-website/assets/logo.png` ❌ NOT FOUND
- Should be:
  - `https://takemycare.me/assets/logo.png` ✅ CORRECT

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

I created a **CNAME** file in your repository that tells GitHub Pages to serve your site at the root domain `takemycare.me` instead of a subdirectory.

**File created:** `CNAME`
**Content:** `takemycare.me`

This has been pushed to GitHub. ✅

## ⏱️ How Long Does It Take?

- **DNS Propagation:** 5-30 minutes (sometimes up to 24 hours)
- **GitHub Pages:** Automatic update within 2-3 minutes after DNS propagates

---

## ✅ How to Verify It's Working

### Test 1: Check DNS Propagation

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
nslookup takemycare.me
```

**Expected result:**
```
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    takemycare.me
Addresses:  185.199.108.153
            185.199.109.153
            185.199.110.153
            185.199.111.153
```

### Test 2: Check Website

**After DNS propagates, visit:**
```
http://takemycare.me
```

**Should automatically redirect to:**
```
https://takemycare.me
```

### Test 3: Check Images

**Test direct image URLs:**

**Logo:**
```
https://takemycare.me/assets/logo.png
```

**Screenshot:**
```
https://takemycare.me/assets/app-screenshot-1.png
```

**If these show images, your site is fixed!** ✅
