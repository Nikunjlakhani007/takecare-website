## 🔍 Why Images Aren't Showing

### **Issue #1: GitHub Pages May Not Be Enabled Yet**

**Solution:** Enable GitHub Pages NOW

1. Go to: https://github.com/Nikunjlakhani007/takecare-website/settings/pages

2. Under **"Source"**:
   - Branch: Select `main`
   - Folder: Select `/ (root)`
   - Click **"Save"**

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

4. Refresh: https://nikunjlakhani007.github.io/takecare-website/

### **Issue #2: GitHub Pages Is Still Deploying**

If you JUST enabled GitHub Pages:

- **Initial deployment takes 2-5 minutes**
- **Wait and refresh** the page every 30 seconds
- Check deployment status at: https://github.com/Nikunjlakhani007/takecare-website/deployments

---

### **Issue #3: Browser Cache**

Clear your browser cache:

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
- Or `Ctrl + F5`

**Firefox:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Safari:**
- Press `Cmd + Option + R`

---

## ✅ Verify GitHub Pages Is Working

### Step 1: Check if GitHub Pages is deployed

Go to: https://github.com/Nikunjlakhani007/takecare-website/settings/pages

You should see:
```
✅ Your site is live at https://nikunjlakhani007.github.io/takecare-website/
```

### Step 2: Test direct asset URLs

Try opening these URLs directly in your browser:

**Logo:**
```
https://nikunjlakhani007.github.io/takecare-website/assets/logo.png
```

**App Screenshot:**
```
https://nikunjlakhani007.github.io/takecare-website/assets/app-screenshot-1.png
```

**About Illustration:**
```
https://nikunjlakhani007.github.io/takecare-website/assets/about-illustration.png
```

If these URLs show the images, then GitHub Pages is working correctly!

## 🛠️ If Images Still Don't Show

### Check 1: View Page Source

1. Go to: https://nikunjlakhani007.github.io/takecare-website/
2. Right-click → "View Page Source"
3. Search for `<img src=`
4. Verify paths are `./assets/logo.png` (correct)

### Check 2: Check Browser Console for Errors

1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for errors like:
   - `404 Not Found` for image files
   - `Failed to load resource`

**Common error:**
```
GET https://nikunjlakhani007.github.io/takecare-website/assets/logo.png 404
```

**If you see 404 errors:**
- GitHub Pages hasn't finished deploying
- Wait 2-3 more minutes and refresh

## 🚀 QUICK FIX: Force GitHub Pages Redeploy

If images still won't load after 5 minutes:

```powershell
cd e:\Takecare\website

# Make a small change to trigger redeploy
echo "<!-- Force redeploy -->" >> index.html

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Force GitHub Pages redeploy"
git push

# Wait 2 minutes, then check again
```
