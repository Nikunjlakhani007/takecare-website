## 🔄 How to Update Website Later

```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "GitHub push asks for password"
- Don't use your GitHub password!
- Create Personal Access Token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Use token as password

### "DNS not working after 1 hour"
1. Check https://dnschecker.org
2. Make sure you added BOTH records (A and CNAME)
3. Make sure Host for A record is exactly: `@`
4. Make sure Host for CNAME is exactly: `www`
5. Clear browser cache: Ctrl + Shift + Delete

### "DigitalOcean says 'Build Failed'"
1. Check if all files were pushed to GitHub
2. Go to GitHub repo and verify files are there
3. In DigitalOcean app settings, check:
   - Build command is empty
   - Output directory is `/`

### "Images don't load on live site"
- Should work fine - we already use relative paths `./assets/`
- If not, clear browser cache

### "HTTPS shows 'Not Secure'"
- Wait 10-15 minutes after DNS propagates
- DigitalOcean auto-generates SSL certificate
- Clear browser cache and try again
